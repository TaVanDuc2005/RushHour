# Rush Hour Puzzle Game
A Python implementation of the classic Rush Hour puzzle game with a graphical interface using Pygame, enhanced with multiple solving algorithms including BFS, DFS, UCS, and A*.

üì¶ Requirements
Make sure to install the required Python libraries before running the project:
'''
pip install pygame
pip install opencv-python
'''

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
Navigate to the project folder and run the main script:

'''
python source/main.py
'''
